Lab Duration: 1 Hour

### Overview


An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users. User groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users.

You can attach an identity-based policy to a user group so that all of the users in the user group receive the policy's permissions.

#### Here are some important characteristics of IAM user groups:

- A user group can contain many users, and a user can belong to multiple user groups.
- User groups can't be nested; they can contain only users, not other user groups.
- There is no default user group that automatically includes all users in the AWS account. If you want to have a user group like that, you must create it and assign each new user to it.
- The number and size of IAM resources in an AWS account, such as the number of groups, and the number of groups that a user can be a member of, are limited.
